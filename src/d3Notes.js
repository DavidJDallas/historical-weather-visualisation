//At its core, D3 is a lib that allows users to draw low-level, highly customisable interactive graphs using JS. It uses SVGs and works by manipulating SVGs using various functions. 

//Selections

//To make selections, use either d3.select() or d3.selectAll(). The former chooses the first one it finds, and the latter selects all. Both functions take a string as their only arguments. 

//Once elements are selected, they can be modified using:
//.style()
//.attr()
// .classed()
// .property()
// .text()
// .html()

//Event Handlers

//Event handlers can be added to selected methods using the .on() method.
//Some common ones:
// .click()
// .mouseenter()
// .mouseover()
// .mouseleave()
// .mouseout()
// .mousemove()

//Inserting and removing elements
